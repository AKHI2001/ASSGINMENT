          Dr. Shakuntala Misra National Rehabilitation University established by Divyangjan Sashaktikaran Vibhag Uttar Pradesh, Government of Uttar Pradesh came up by an Ordinance dated August 29, 2008, later replaced by U.P. Act No. 1 of 2009, dated February 19, 2009 and U.P. Act No. 24 of 2011, dated November 28, 2011.

The first University of its kind, which also provides accessible and quality higher education to challenged students, in a completely barrier-free environment.

We are unique, much different from others...

Our mandate is primarily to serve the differently-abled segment (challenged students) of the society for which a horizontal reservation of 50% seats in all courses of the University has been provided, in addition to the normal reservation policy.
