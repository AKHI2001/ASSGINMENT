                A clutch is a mechanical device that engages and disengages power transmission, especially from a drive shaft (driving shaft) to a driven shaft. ... In a motor vehicle, the clutch acts as a mechanical linkage between the engine and transmission, and briefly disconnects, or separates the engine from the transmission system.
                <br/><br/><br/>The Clutch is the most important part of the engine in an automobile. A clutch uses to transfer rotating motion or torque from one shaft to another shaft when requires. The torque developed by the engine at the initial speed is very low. Therefore it is impossible to start the engine under load.

<br/><br/><br/>Hence a device that use to engage and disengage the engine from the transmission system is called a clutch. It is permits the gradual taking of load when adequately operated, thereby it prevents jerky motion of the vehicle, and this avoids undue strain on the parts of the vehicle as well as passengers.
